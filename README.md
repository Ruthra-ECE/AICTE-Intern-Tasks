# Campus_Network_Design

## Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a campus network utilizing VLAN, DHCP, and RIP protocols. The aim is to create a scalable, efficient, and manageable network infrastructure suitable for a campus environment.

## Features

- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):** Segmentation of network traffic to enhance security and performance by isolating different departments or groups within the campus.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automated assignment of IP addresses to devices on the network, ensuring efficient IP address management and reducing manual configuration efforts.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Dynamic routing to facilitate data packet transfer across the network, ensuring optimal path selection and redundancy.

## Project Structure

- **Configurations:** Contains configuration files for switches and routers.
- **Diagrams:** Network topology diagrams illustrating the VLAN setup, DHCP scopes, and RIP routing.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation on the network design, implementation steps, and testing procedure

## Prerequisites

- Network simulation software (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3)
- Basic understanding of networking concepts and protocols

## Usage

- **VLAN Setup:** Configuration files for creating and managing VLANs on switches.
- **DHCP Setup:** Scripts and instructions for setting up DHCP servers and scopes.
- **RIP Setup:** Configuration files for enabling and configuring RIP on routers.
